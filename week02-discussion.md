# Week 2 Discussion: Why Measures of Center & Variation Matter

> *This discussion demonstrates how variation can uncover critical performance differences that averages alone may conceal, enhancing analysis of team output and delivery risk.*

## **Discussion Topic**

#### Why is it important to consider both measures of center and measures of variation when analyzing a dataset? Provide an example and construct a boxplot to visualize your explanation. Cite your sources.

When analyzing business data sets, examining only measures of center provides an incomplete and potentially misleading picture. As Triola explains in our textbook, *"we need objective measures instead of relying on subjective judgments"* when evaluating variation (Triola, 2022, p. 105). This principle is essential when drawing accurate results because two data sets can have identical means, but *dramatically* different amounts of variation.

Drawing from my project management experience, I've created the following scenario: Two software development teams, **Team Alpha** and **Team Beta**, both complete an average of 15 user stories per sprint over their last 10 sprints. (A user-story is a feature or task that needs to be completed, and a sprint is the 1–4 week window given to complete the tasks.) Their performance data shows:

**Team Alpha completion rates:** 14, 15, 16, 15, 14, 15, 16, 14, 15, 16  
**Team Beta completion rates:** 8, 25, 12, 18, 6, 22, 15, 19, 10, 15

While both teams have identical means (15 user stories completed), their variations greatly differ. **Team Alpha** shows minimal variation with a standard deviation of 0.82, while **Team Beta** exhibits substantial variation with a standard deviation of 5.94.

This difference in variation has *critical business consequences.* A development team with excessive variation in sprint completion can create significant project management challenges.

**Team Alpha's consistent performance** enables reliable sprint planning and delivery schedules. **Team Beta's high variation,** even though they are *capable* of delivering 25 user stories per sprint, creates uncertainty that could often jeopardize project timelines and client commitments.

The **boxplot** shows that while both teams are centered on the same mean, one team has a much greater range of results. This contrast makes it easy for stakeholders to spot the difference in their project performance.
