## **Discussion Topic**
#### Describe the steps in hypothesis testing and discuss the differences between testing a population mean and a population proportion. Use an example for each and explain how results are interpreted. Cite your sources.

In project management, **hypothesis testing** could provide a structured approach for validating project outcomes and promoting data-driven decisions. The process involves five steps: stating your **null and alternative hypotheses**, selecting a significance level (typically *0.05*), choosing the appropriate test statistic, calculating the **P-value**, and making a decision based on the results (Triola, 2020).

When selecting what method to use, I need to factor in the type of data I have available to me. If I was measuring success rates, compliance percentages, or other yes/no outcomes, I would use **proportion tests with z-statistics**. When measuring performance metrics, think response times or processing speeds, I'd use **mean tests with t-statistics**.

For a lot of project managers, project success is often measured by completion rates. Hypothesis testing would allow me to shift the focus to actual performance improvements with statistical evidence.

**Proportion Example:**  
Testing if cybersecurity training increases compliance above our 60% baseline.  
H₀: p ≤ 0.60 vs H₁: p > 0.60. After training 200 employees, 138 comply (69%). Using z-test, P-value = 0.015. Since 0.015 < 0.05, **I reject H₀**: the data shows that the training initiatives have significantly improved company compliance.

**Mean Example:**  
Testing if server upgrades reduce response times from 4.2 seconds.  
H₀: μ = 4.2 vs H₁: μ < 4.2. Measuring 35 post-upgrade responses with mean = 3.7 seconds. Using t-test, P-value = 0.008. Since 0.008 < 0.05, **I reject H₀**: the data shows that the server upgrades have significantly reduced the standard response times.

This statistical approach would help me move beyond basic project metrics and demonstrate to key leadership how their IT investments are delivering real, measurable business results.
