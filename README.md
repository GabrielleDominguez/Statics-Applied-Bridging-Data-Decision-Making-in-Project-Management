## About This Project

As a project manager with a passion for data-driven decision making, I am applying statistical theories and methods to improve processes, planning, and outcomes in business settings. These weekly discussions reflect my learning journey and how I connect course material to practical scenarios.

Each discussion contains:  
- A **professor’s prompt** outlining the topic  
- My **written analysis** applying statistics to project management  
- **Peer replies** and my **responses** to deepen the conversation  
- Relevant **references** for further study
